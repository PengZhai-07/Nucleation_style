case166  with larger transition zone

case167  works
case169  with larger resolution 48 and larger transition zone

increase normal stress
case170 with fault zone
case171 without fault zone


case172  decrease criticalness(increase resolution)  0.3  and decrease tolerance(1e-10)   fail
case173  decrease criticalness(increase resolution)  0.3  
when fault zone exists, more difficult to converge: increase resolution or decrease tolerance

case174  tol = 1e-6 

case176   correct the equation for nucleation size estimation!!
